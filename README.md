**Glider is the logger for just about everything!**
It's designed to be:
- **SIMPLE**: with a modular & extensible architecture, fully documented
- **PERFORMANT**: you can use Glider without the worry of impacting your app performances
- **UNIVERSAL**: it supports 14+ transports to satisfy every need; you can create your transport too!

# Why Logging?

Logging and monitoring are fundamental parts of our job as engineers.  
Especially in the mobile world (with very heterogeneous environments), you'll often find yourself in a situation where understanding how your software behaves in production is essential.

That's the right job for logging: logged data provide valuable information that would be difficult to gather otherwise, unveil unexpected behaviors and bugs, and even if the data was adequately anonymized, identify the sequences of actions of singular users.

# Feature Highlights

We loved making this open-source package and would see engineers like you using this software.  
Those are five reasons you will love Glider:

- üß© 14+ built-in, fully customizable transports to store your data ([ELK](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/GliderELK/Sources), [HTTP](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/blob/main/Glider/Sources/Transports/HTTPTransport/HTTPTransport.swift), [Logstash](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/Glider/Sources/Transports/LogstashTransport), [SQLite](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/Glider/Sources/Transports/SQLiteTransport), [WebSocket](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/Glider/Sources/Transports/WebSocketTransport), [Console](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/Glider/Sources/Transports/Console), [File/Rotating Files](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/Glider/Sources/Transports/File), [POSIX](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/Glider/Sources/Transports/File/POSIXTransports), [swift-log](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/GliderSwiftLog/Sources), [sentry.io](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/GliderSentry/Sources)...)
- ‚úèÔ∏è 7+ customizable formatters for log messages ([JSON](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/Glider/Sources/Formatters/JSONFormatter), [Fields based](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/Glider/Sources/Formatters/FieldsFormatter)), [MsgPack](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/Glider/Sources/Formatters/MsgPackFormatter), [Syslog](https://github.com/malcommac/Glider/tree/main/Glider/Sources/Formatters/SysLogFormatter))...)
- üöÄ A simple API set with an extensible architecture to suit your need
- üìö A fully documented code (check out our DoCC site!)
- ‚öôÔ∏è An extensive unit test suite
  
# One Line Implementation

Creating a logger is simple.  
Each logger is an instance of the `Log` class; typically, you need to specify one or more transports (where the data is stored).

```swift
let logger = Log {
 $0.subsystem = "com.my-awesome-app"
 $0.category = "ui-events"
 $0.level = .info
 $0.transports = [ConsoleTransport()]
}
```

The following logger shows received messages - only warning or more severe - in the console.

```swift
// Logs an error (including stack trace)
logger.error?.write("Unexpected error has occurred!", 
                    extra: ["reason": error.localizedDescription, "info": extraInfoDict])

logger.info?.write { // Logs an event with a set of attached details
  $0.message = "User tapped Buy button"
  $0.object = encodableProduct
  $0.extra = ["price": price, "currency": currency]
  $0.tags = ["productId", pID]
}
```

## API Reference

Glider is fully documented at source-code level. You'll get autocomplete with doc inside XCode for free; moreover, you can read the full Apple's DoCC Documentation automatically generated by [**Swift Package Index**](https://swiftpackageindex.com) project from here:

# Third Party Transports

Glider is a lightweight yet extensible library. The following packages are available outside the main core of the library:

- [Glider-AppleSwiftLog](https://github.com/immobiliare/Glider-AppleSwiftLog) can also work as a backend for [apple/swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/).
- [Glider-ELK](https://github.com/immobiliare/Glider-ELK): library provides a logging transport for glider and [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack?ultron=B-Stack-Trials-EMEA-S-Exact&gambit=Stack-ELK&blade=adwords-s&hulk=paid&Device=c&thor=elk%20stack&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjIKYBhC6ARIsAGEds-I1kAzd4o5RdmCR0U4yXPL4QFQXBCn1bRn-MjwZV0fkSXuFIIJ6VcwaAo1AEALw_wcB) stacks.
- [Glider-Sentry](https://github.com/immobiliare/Glider-Sentry): provides support to post log on [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/welcome/) instances using the native swift sdk.
- [Glider-NetWatcher](https://github.com/immobiliare/Glider-NetWatcher) offers the ability to capture your app's network traffic (including requests/responses) and redirect them to a specific transport.
# Test Suite

Glider offers an extensive suite of unit tests for Glider Core Logger and third-party packages under the `/Tests` folder.

Moreover, the entire package is powered by [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for better code quality.

# Help Us!

If you want to join this project, we're maintaining a list of new features we would like to implement into the following versions of Glider. 
Please open an issue and discuss one of them with us!

- [ ] GliderViewer: a macOS, iPad & iPhone app to view and interact with logged data
- [ ] New Transports: we would like to extend the list of supported transports; feel free to propose your third-party transports
- [ ] Increment our code coverage by writing more tests

# Requirements

Glider can be installed on any platform which supports:

- Swift 5.0
- iOS 10, macOS 10.14, macCatalyst, tvOS 13
- Xcode 13.2

# Installation

## Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. It is in early development, but Glider does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Glider as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/immobiliare/Glider.git")
]
```

Manifest also includes third-party packages for other transports, like ELK or Sentry.  
The Glider core SDK is the `Glider` package.

## CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.  
To integrate Glider into your project, specify it in your Podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
use_frameworks!

pod 'GliderLogger'
```

## Powered Apps

Glider was created by the amazing mobile team at [ImmobiliareLabs](http://labs.immobiliare.it), the Tech dept at Immobiliare.it.
We are currently using Glider for logging in to all of our products.

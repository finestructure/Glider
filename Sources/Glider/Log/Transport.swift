    /// log facility is inherently single-threaded and/or proper message ordering
    /// wouldn't be ensured otherwise. However, a concurrent queue may also be
    /// used, and might be appropriate when logging to databases or network endpoints.
    ///
    /// You can avoid to use a dispatch queue especially if you are not working with a remote
    /// transporter; in this case use `nil` to receive message from the same queue of the
    /// `LogTransporter` instance.

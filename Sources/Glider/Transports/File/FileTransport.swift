/// `FileTransport` is a simple log appender that provides no mechanism
/// for file rotation or truncation. Unless you manually manage the log file when
/// a `FileLogRecorder` doesn't have it open, you will end up with an ever-growing
/// file.
/// Use a `RotatingLogTrasport` instead if you'd rather not have to concern
/// yourself with such details.

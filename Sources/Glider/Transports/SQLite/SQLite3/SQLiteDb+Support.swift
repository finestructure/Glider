    ///             the rollback journal is deleted at the conclusion of each transaction.
    ///             Indeed, the delete operation is the action that causes the transaction to commit.
    ///             (See the document titled Atomic Commit In SQLite for additional detail.)
    /// - `truncate`: The TRUNCATE journaling mode commits transactions by truncating the rollback journal
    ///               to zero-length instead of deleting it. On many systems, truncating a file is much faster
    ///               than deleting the file since the containing directory does not need to be changed.
    /// - `persist`: The PERSIST journaling mode prevents the rollback journal from being deleted at the
    ///              end of each transaction. Instead, the header of the journal is overwritten with zeros.
    ///              This will prevent other database connections from rolling the journal back. The PERSIST
    ///              journaling mode is useful as an optimization on platforms where deleting or truncating
    ///              a file is much more expensive than overwriting the first block of a file with zeros.
    ///
    ///              See also: (PRAGMA journal_size_limit)[https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_size_limit]
    ///              and [SQLITE_DEFAULT_JOURNAL_SIZE_LIMIT](https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html#default_journal_size_limit).
    ///  - `memory`: The WAL journaling mode uses [a write-ahead log](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) instead of a
    ///              rollback journal to implement transactions. The WAL journaling mode is persistent;
    ///              after being set it stays in effect across multiple database connections and after
    ///              closing and reopening the database. A database in WAL journaling mode can only be
    ///              accessed by SQLite version 3.7.0 (2010-07-21) or later.
    ///  - `wal`: The WAL journaling mode uses [a write-ahead log](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html) instead of a rollback
    ///           journal to implement transactions. The WAL journaling mode is persistent; after being set it stays in
    ///           effect across multiple database connections and after closing and reopening the database.
    ///           A database in WAL journaling mode can only be accessed by SQLite version 3.7.0 (2010-07-21) or later.
    ///  - `off`: The OFF journaling mode disables the rollback journal completely. No rollback journal is ever created
    ///           and hence there is never a rollback journal to delete. The OFF journaling mode disables the atomic commit
    ///           and rollback capabilities of SQLite. The ROLLBACK command no longer works; it behaves in an undefined way.
    ///           Applications must avoid using the ROLLBACK command when the journal mode is OFF. If the application crashes
    ///           in the middle of a transaction when the OFF journaling mode is set, then the database file will very likely go corrupt.
    ///           Without a journal, there is no way for a statement to unwind partially completed operations following a constraint error.
    ///           This might also leave the database in a corrupted state.
    ///           For example, if a duplicate entry causes a CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement to fail half-way through,
    ///           it will leave behind a partially created, and hence corrupt, index.
    ///           Because OFF journaling mode allows the database file to be corrupted using ordinary SQL,

    ///            When auto-vacuum is disabled and data is deleted data from a database, the database f
    ///            ile remains the same size. Unused database file pages are added to a "freelist" and reused for subsequent inserts.

    /// - `full`: When the auto-vacuum mode is 1 or "full", the freelist pages are moved to the end of the database
    ///           file and the database file is truncated to remove the freelist pages at every transaction commit.

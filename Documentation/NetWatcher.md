## Introduction

`NetWatcher` package is a simple, unintrusive network activity logger perfectly integrated in Glider.
Log every request your app makes, or limit to only those using a certain `URLSession` if you'd prefer. 
It also works with Alamofire and RealHTTP, if that's your thing.

- Enable logging across your app with just 1 line of code
- Verbose and Light debugging modes
- Works with URLSession, URLConnection, RealHTTP, Alamofire and pretty much any networking framework
- Pretty printed JSON responses
- Useful for debugging and development, but probably best not to ship your app with verbose logging.

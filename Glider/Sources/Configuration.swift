/// This protocol is used to offer a type-safe way to declare log identifiers
/// properties `subsystem` and `category`
///
/// While you can use a simple `String` to define the identifier of a log, a more
/// swifty way is to declare an enum conform to this protocol and avoid literals in your code.
/// For example:
///
/// ```swift
/// enum Loggers: String, LoggerIdentifiable {
///    case storage = "storage-layer"
///    case network = "network-layer"
///
///    public static let subsystem = "com.myawesomeapp"
///
///    public var id: String { rawValue }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And use it to create your new logger instead of passing string literals.
///
/// ```swift
/// let networkLogger = Log {
///    $0.subsystem = Loggers.subsystem
///    $0.category = Loggers.network
///    // other configuration...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Aside from suggestions your are free to use `$0.subsystem = "com.myawesomeapp"`.

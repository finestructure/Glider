/// `Log` class represents an instance of a logger, which is the entry point for all your application's messages.
/// You can create one or multiple logger instances depending on the complexity of your application infrastructure or your needs.
///
/// Log messages in Glider are events; when you create a new log entry for a `Log` instance,
/// you're making a payload of type `Event` representing a snapshot of the application into a particular moment.
/// Each `Event` has a message text (which describes a context), a severity level (to indicate the typology of the message,
/// from notice to a warning or error), and some additional context properties like metadata, stack trace, or attached objects.
///
/// To initialize a logger, you can pass a `Configuration` object or, more quickly, by using a configuration callback.
/// A logger is uniquely identified by a pair of properties: `subsystem` and `category`; `subsystem` helps you to track
/// and identify the logger. Typically this is the bundle identifier of the package which produces the log messages.
/// You can use `category` further to distinguish a logger inside the same `subsystem`.
///
/// Logger also exposes two important properties:
/// Severity `level`: indicates the minimum severity accepted by the log. Any received message with a lower priority
/// than the one currently set is discarded.
/// An array of `Transport: A transport is a destination bucket for messages.
/// It can be a local file on a disk, a database, or a remote destination service (like an ELK stack or a remote socket connection).
/// Glider offers a broad set of built-in transport, but you are free to create a new implementation to suit your needs.
///
/// ```swift
///    let fileTransport = try FileTransport(fileURL: fileURL, {
///      $0.formatters = [jsonFormatter]
///    })
///
///    let log = Log {
///      $0.subsystem = "com.myawesomeapp"
///      $0.category = "storage"
///      $0.level = .warning
///      $0.transports = [fileTransport, ConsoleTransport()]
///    }
/// ```
///
/// The code above creates a new logger instance that accepts only messages with at least `warning` severity
/// and dispatches them to two different destinations: a local file on disk and a console.
/// To send messages to a logger, call one of the available `write()` functions to the desired severity level:
///
/// ```swift
/// log.error?.write(msg: "An error occurred while proceding to checkout")
/// ```
///
/// The code above send an error message to the logger; the logger itself accept the message because the severity
/// is higher than `warning` severity set.

/// The `Scope` is a global structure you can assign to `GliderSDK.shared.scope` variable.
/// A scope is inerithed automatically by each new `Event` created.
/// Inside a scope you can store global information useful for debugging, like the
/// currently logged user, a tags dictionary or a fingerprint.
